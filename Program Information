This program, written in python, takes in user input (a number in degrees or radians) and returns the coordinates, in the (x, y) format,
of the angle measurement.
Permission is given to those who wish to use this program for personal use or for educational purposes ONLY (citation is not needed).
Please DO NOT use this program as a means of making money.

Fixes in the March 2019 update:
1. Users can now enter a string, such as "sqrt2" or "sqrt3", in which they can then multiply this value by any number they choose.
2. A value of pi is now accepted as input (taken in as a string and then multiplied by a value determined by the user).

Bugs that must be addressed:
1. Some values do not work when the user is prompted to enter x and y coordinates for a coordinate on the unit circle.
2. Users cannot enter radian values (when trying to find a coordinate on the unit circle) that are greater than 2Ï€.
3. If the coordinate the user entered is not located in the unit circle, a message must be displayed telling the user this.

***THESE BUGS WILL BE FIXED ASAP!***

NOTE: This program is currently in development. This file will be updated periodically when a new update has occurred.
